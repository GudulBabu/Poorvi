<h1>KOALA</h1>

<p>I like this animal <b><i>KOALA</i></b>.  Here's some information about this animal:</p>
<p>The koala, sometimes known as the koala bear, is an Australian arboreal herbivorous mammal. It is the only living member of the Phascolarctidae family, and its nearest living relatives are wombats, who belong to the Vombatidae family. The koala lives along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia's mainland, in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Its stout, tailless body and huge head with round, fluffy ears and a large, spoon-shaped nose make it instantly identifiable. The koala measures 60–85 cm (24–33 in) in length and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown.Koalas inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees account for the majority of their food. Koalas are mostly inactive and sleep up to 20 hours a day due to their eucalyptus diet's low nutritional and caloric content.</p>
This animal appeals to me since it sleeps virtually the entire day, which I find appealing. Although some people refer to koalas as "bears," these amazing creatures are actually marsupials, not bears. The majority of marsupials have pouches in which their young develop. Another thing I appreciate about them is that they are incredibly cute. These are some of my favourite aspects of koalas.</p>
